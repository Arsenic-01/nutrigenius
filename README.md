## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up a local copy of the project for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- A Clerk account for authentication keys.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Arsenic-01/nutrigenius.git](https://github.com/Arsenic-01/nutrigenius.git)
    cd nutrigenius
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

To connect the frontend to your backend API and Clerk, you need to create an environment variable file.

1.  Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
2.  Add the following variables. You can get the Clerk keys from your Clerk dashboard.

    ```
    # Backend API URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000

    # Clerk Authentication Keys
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
    ```

    _Note: If you have deployed your backend, replace the local API URL with your live Render URL (e.g., `https://url-of-your-backend.onrender.com`)._

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- **`npm run dev`**
  Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- **`npm run build`**
  Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.

- **`npm run start`**
  Starts a production server after building the application.

## üö¢ Deployment

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js application is by using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

1.  **Push your code** to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Import your project** on the Vercel dashboard.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables:** In your Vercel project settings, add your `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`.
4.  **Deploy:** Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application.
